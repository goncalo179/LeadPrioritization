# Lead Prioritization

Lead prioritization using decision trees and random forests based on customer behavior.
This project analyzes potential customers' behaviour to prioritize high-value leads using Decision Trees and Random Forests.
By training classification models, this project predicts lead conversion likelihood to help focus on the most promising prospects.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the raw data files ("ExtraaLearn.csv").
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with data cleaning, visualization, and analysis ("ExtraaLearn_Project.ipynb").
- **requirements.txt**: Dependencies needed to run the project.

## Key Insights
- Feature analysis to understand key indicators of lead conversion.
- Decision Tree and Random Forest models to prioritize leads effectively.
- Strategic recommendations based on model insights and feature analysis to optimize business outreach.


## Requirements
- Google Colab (Recommended) - Python 3.x pre-installed
- OR Local Setup - Requires Python 3.x (Download from python.org)
- Install required packages from "requirements.txt"

**Note:** If you're using Google Colab, prefix commands with "!", e.g., "!git clone ...". On a local setup, use the commands without "!", e.g., "git clone ...".


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
 
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/goncalo179/LeadPrioritization.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
    
```bash
